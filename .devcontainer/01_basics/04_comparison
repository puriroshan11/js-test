console.log(2 >= 1);
console.log("2" > 1); //true
console.log( null > 0);

// >, == converts null to 0
// == and === works differently in javascript

// === it checks the value as well as the data types
// no problem with the basic comparison
// comaprison with null and undefined might lead to problem.
